# ü§ù Collaboration Workflow

## üç¥ Forking & Contributing to Open Source

### Fork a Repository
1. **Navigate to the repository** you want to contribute to
2. **Click "Fork"** in the top-right corner
3. **Choose your account** as the destination
4. **Clone your fork locally:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   cd REPOSITORY_NAME
   ```

### Set Up Upstream Remote
```bash
# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream git@github.com:ORIGINAL_OWNER/REPOSITORY_NAME.git

# Verify remotes
git remote -v
```

### Keep Your Fork Updated
```bash
# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/main

# Push updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

## üîÑ Open Source Contribution Process

### 1. Find Issues to Work On
- Look for labels: `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `beginner-friendly`
- Read the project's `CONTRIBUTING.md` file
- Check if the issue is already assigned
- Ask questions in the issue comments if unclear

### 2. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b fix/issue-description

# Or for features
git checkout -b feature/add-new-functionality
```

### 3. Make Your Changes
- **Follow the project's coding standards**
- **Write clear commit messages**
- **Add tests** if applicable
- **Update documentation** as needed

### 4. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Run existing tests
npm test
# or
python -m pytest

# Run linting
npm run lint
# or
flake8 .

# Test manually to ensure nothing breaks
```

### 5. Submit Your Pull Request
```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin fix/issue-description
```

**PR Description Template:**
```markdown

## üë• Team Collaboration Workflows

### Git Flow Model
```bash
# Main branches
main          # Production-ready code
develop       # Integration branch

# Supporting branches
feature/      # New features
release/      # Prepare releases
hotfix/       # Emergency fixes
```

**Feature Development:**
```bash
# Start feature from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add user login functionality"

# Finish feature
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/user-authentication
git push origin develop
git branch -d feature/user-authentication
```

### GitHub Flow (Simpler)
```bash
# Everything branches from main
main          # Always deployable

# Feature workflow
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
# Make changes
git push origin feature/new-feature
# Create PR to main
# Deploy from main
```

## üîç Code Review Process

### As a Reviewer
**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] **Code quality:** Clean, readable, well-structured
- [ ] **Functionality:** Does it work as intended?
- [ ] **Tests:** Are there appropriate tests?
- [ ] **Performance:** Any performance implications?
- [ ] **Security:** No security vulnerabilities?
- [ ] **Documentation:** Is documentation updated?

**Review Comments:**
```markdown
# Constructive feedback
Consider using a more descriptive variable name here.

# Suggestions
What do you think about extracting this into a separate function?

# Questions
Could you explain why you chose this approach?

# Approval
LGTM! Nice work on the error handling.
```

### As a Contributor
**Responding to Reviews:**
- **Be receptive** to feedback
- **Ask questions** if something is unclear
- **Make requested changes** promptly
- **Explain your reasoning** when you disagree
- **Thank reviewers** for their time

**Updating Your PR:**
```bash
# Make requested changes
git add .
git commit -m "Address code review feedback"
git push origin feature/branch-name
```

## üö® Handling Merge Conflicts

### Understanding Conflicts
Conflicts occur when:
- Same lines are modified in different branches
- One branch deletes a file while another modifies it
- Binary files are modified differently

### Resolving Conflicts
```bash
# Fetch latest changes
git fetch upstream

# Start merge/rebase
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git checkout feature/branch
git rebase main

# If conflicts occur, Git will pause
# Edit conflicted files manually
# Look for conflict markers:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Their changes
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

**Conflict Resolution Steps:**
1. **Open conflicted files** in your editor
2. **Decide which changes to keep**
3. **Remove conflict markers** (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
4. **Test the resolution**
5. **Stage the resolved files:**
   ```bash
   git add resolved-file.js
   ```
6. **Complete the merge/rebase:**
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   # or
   git commit
   ```

### Preventing Conflicts
- **Communicate with team** about what you're working on
- **Keep branches small** and focused
- **Regularly sync** with main branch
- **Use feature flags** for large changes

## üìã Team Workflows & Standards

### Branch Naming Conventions
```
feature/user-authentication
